Your task is to edit the rsdportfolio.html which is a template from PortfolioDetails5.html, but we will change the content since we want kinda same layout, For the Robot System Design Project, basically it was a module at my uni where I did like 3 mini-projects in one unit, that's why I don't want to make them separate. so int he rsdportfolio.md, you notice there are 2 sectins tabs where one can click and it switches, but now we are gonna make them 3 which will comprise of 

1. Automated Assembly Project
/home/abdvswmdr/Documents/abdvswmdr.github.io/assets/automated_assembly_project/Automated_Assembly_Project_RSD.pdf
2. Robot Simulation ABB
/home/abdvswmdr/Documents/abdvswmdr.github.io/assets/robot_simulation/101229220_Robot_Simulation_Individual_Assignment.pdf
3. Hand-Eye Coordination Project
/home/abdvswmdr/Documents/abdvswmdr.github.io/assets/hand_eye_coordination/rme40003_hand_eye_coordination_project.pdf

You will go through the pdf's of both the 3 projects thoroughly and then go through the file @engineering_portfolio_guidelines.md. 
You will edit the rsdportfolio.html, while following strictly the guidelines from /home/abdvswmdr/Documents/abdvswmdr.github.io/engineering_portfolio_guidelines.md

Do use Git Flow method to do this so you will make a new branch, the we work on putting these 3 projects then later, we'll merge them to the main branch after review. I have already started and put the projects but I just haven't yet edit some parts or didn't include some key pictures for the projects. 

Also, I'm looking to apply to a job role I saw, I put the details in the file robotics_engineer_job.md , so perhaps we can tailor these 3 projects to be more fitting to that job if the project would relate since I need higher chances of gettng the job.
