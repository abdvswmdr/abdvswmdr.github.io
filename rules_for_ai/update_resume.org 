I just saw a post recently on my Canvas student email from one of the lecturers. I am currently a final year student of mechatronics engineering at the university. I'm doing a robotics and mechatronics bachelor's degree. The post is looking for research assistants from three... They are required to make a digital metronome. So I don't know what a digital metronome is, and perhaps I want to have a good approach into this. Like, how do I approach this? How do I learn about the thing and eventually apply for the internship? Myself, I am mostly versed into robotics engineering. I like programming. I am good at C++ programming and C programming. I've previously done projects in embedded systems, whereby we had to make a digital watch. And also I've done an internship in a drone company where I had to do low-level programming. So I want you to... I will send you my resume as well as my website and also my cover letter. And I want you to refine it. And perhaps you can give me tips on how to go about applying for this internship. Also, I just want you to scrutinize my backgrounds and my skills and my resume. Perhaps I could change some things on my resume. Also, just tell me what to learn right now. Like, what should I learn so as to be on the edge to get this internship and do the job? Like, what should I focus on right now?
