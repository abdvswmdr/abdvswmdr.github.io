I'm working on a personal repository that includes my resume(s) and personal website. I’ve organized the repo into multiple directories, each containing a resume and possibly a cover letter tailored for a specific robotics-related role. These include roles like:

Robotics Software Engineer

Embedded Robotics Engineer

Robotics Hardware (Electronics/Mechatronics) Engineer

Mechanical Robotics Engineer

I also maintain a general-purpose resume for career fairs or networking events where job roles might not be clearly defined.

Whenever I upload or paste a resume or cover letter from this repo, I want your help with:

Editing and polishing the content.

Tailoring the resume or cover letter to specific job types, based on the target role or company.

Providing feedback on structure, clarity, tone, and formatting.

Suggesting relevant skills, keywords, and metrics to improve my chances of getting interviews.

Making sure everything aligns with best practices in tech/robotics hiring, especially for recent graduates or junior engineers.

I’ll specify whether it's a role-specific resume, a generic resume, or a cover letter when I share it with you.
